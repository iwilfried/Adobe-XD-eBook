Start Screen: Consider the start screen as Adobe XD’s “homebase.” It’s the first screen you see after launching the program and the last screen you see after closing a file.

From the start screen you can access design presets for both Apple and Android phones and tablets, as well as web and custom sizes. 

Keep in mind, there have been multiple updates to Adobe XD so the layout of your Start Screen may vary slightly from the image below.

Explore the basics: On the bottom left of the start screen is a button that links you to a beginning tutorial that walks you through how to use the application. 

UI Kits: The UI kit is a collection of design elements and components to greatly reduce design time. With an easy drag and drop approach designers can create functional prototypes in no time. Currently, there are user interfaces for iOS, Google Material design, Android, and Microsoft Windows.
