Masking is another design option that has endless possibilities and can be incredibly time-saving.

Begin with your image. Using a shape tool, draw around the image. Keep in mind that the white area represents what will be left of the image once you mask using the shape.

In this example, I have used the ellipse tool to draw an oval shape for my mask.

In the Object Menu, select “Mask with Shape.”

Keep in mind that masking is not a destructive step in design. The masked area is essentially hidden, not deleted. You can go back and edit the entire image at any time.

Once the operation is complete, a masked group will appear in the layers panel.
