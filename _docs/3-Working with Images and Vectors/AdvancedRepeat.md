As stated in previous sections, the Repeat Grid feature in Adobe XD is a powerful, time-saving tool that designers will love.   


<img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:left;" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-Repeat-01.png" alt="no image"/>Select your artboard and create the basic outline of the element you want to repeat. In this example I used an element from the UI Kit. I copied and pasted it to my artboard and change the wording to match my needs.

When you have created the object you need you need to marquee select all the elements in the object—shapes, text, etc.

Next, select “Repeat Grid” from the Property Inspector menu on the right side of the screen.

You will know when Repeat Grid is active because the object will be surrounded by a green border with green handles.

In this example, I used the handle at the bottom to drag the pattern down vertically. 

You could also pull the handle on the side horizontally if that is your preference. 

You can even drag it both ways to create the shape and pattern you need for your design.

The pink highlighted area is the gap or the gutter space and it can be adjusted very easily.

As you adjust the width here it will adjust the gap space between every element in your grid.

This simple step ensures you have the spacing exactly how you want it. If your grid extends below the artboard it will become a scrolling screen.

The repeat grid does more than just duplicate objects. Let’s look at the functionality behind the repeat grid.  

&nbsp;   

I created four objects for employee entries. I will list their full name, company, email and include an image.
I have a text file with each employee's name on a different line. I am going to drag this file directly onto the artboard to the text box that says “Full Name.”
When I let go of the mouse the name automatically populate—in order— into the grid.

&nbsp;   

Now I will do the same thing for the employee emails. Drag and rop and they automatically populate into the selected email text box. Remember to ensure the order is correct. Adobe XD pastes the emails based on the order in the text file—each name on its own line.

This step is not just possible with text files. You can also drag and drop image files into a repeat grid. Again, keep in mind the images need to be in separate files and in the order you want them placed.

Here all the headshots are copied into the appropriate square within my grid.
 
If I select one of the images in the grid I have the standard design handles in each corner to manipulate the shape.
 
When you make changes to something within the grid, the changes are mirrored on all remaining parts of the grid design

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   
For example, let’s say I wanted to add another shape, or text box. As I draw the rectangle in my first entry you can see the exact shape automatically appears in each section of the grid below.
