As stated in previous sections, the Repeat Grid feature in Adobe XD is a powerful, time-saving tool that designers will love.   


<img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:left;" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-Repeat-01.png" alt="no image"/>Select your artboard and create the basic outline of the element you want to repeat. In this example I used an element from the UI Kit. I copied and pasted it to my artboard and change the wording to match my needs.
