As stated in previous sections, the Repeat Grid feature in Adobe XD is a powerful, time-saving tool that designers will love.   


<img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:left;" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-Repeat-01.png" alt="no image"/>Select your artboard and create the basic outline of the element you want to repeat. In this example I used an element from the UI Kit. I copied and pasted it to my artboard and change the wording to match my needs.

When you have created the object you need you need to marquee select all the elements in the object—shapes, text, etc.

Next, select “Repeat Grid” from the Property Inspector menu on the right side of the screen.

You will know when Repeat Grid is active because the object will be surrounded by a green border with green handles.
