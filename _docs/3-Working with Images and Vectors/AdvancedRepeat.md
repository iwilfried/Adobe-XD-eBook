As stated in previous sections, the Repeat Grid feature in Adobe XD is a powerful, time-saving tool that designers will love.

In this example I used an element from the UI Kit. I copied and pasted it to my artboard and change the wording to match my needs.

When you have created the object you need you need to marquee select all the elements in the object—shapes, text, etc.

Next, select “Repeat Grid” from the Property Inspector menu on the right side of the screen.

You will know when Repeat Grid is active because the object will be surrounded by a green border with green handles.

In this example, I used the handle at the bottom to drag the pattern down vertically. 

You could also pull the handle on the side horizontally if that is your preference. 

You can even drag it both ways to create the shape and pattern you need for your design.

The pink highlighted area is the gap or the gutter space and it can be adjusted very easily.

As you adjust the width here it will adjust the gap space between every element in your grid.

This simple step ensures you have the spacing exactly how you want it. If your grid extends below the artboard it will become a scrolling screen.

The repeat grid does more than just duplicate objects. Let’s look at the functionality behind the repeat grid.  

&nbsp;   

I created four objects for employee entries. I will list their full name, company, email and include an image.
I have a text file with each employee's name on a different line. I am going to drag this file directly onto the artboard to the text box that says “Full Name.”
When I let go of the mouse the name automatically populate—in order— into the grid.
