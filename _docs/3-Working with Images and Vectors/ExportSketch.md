In this chapter, we are going to cover bringing external assets in Adobe XD. You can use assets from Adobe products, like Photoshop and Illustrator, or from third party applications. In this section we will cover the third party application Sketch.  


<img style="padding: 0px 15px; float: left" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-Export-Sketch-01.png" alt="no image"/>In this example I have an image I want to export from Sketch into Adobe XD.
There are a couple of ways I can do this. First, I need to make the image exportable. I can do this by using the Share menu and selecting
“Make Exportable” from the drop down menu.  




<img style="padding: 0px 15px; float: right" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-Export-Sketch-02.png" alt="no image"/>Another option is to select the image and click the + sign next to the “Make Exportable” button at the bottom of the right column.


<img style="padding: 0px 15px; float: left" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-Export-Sketch-03.png" alt="no image"/>In the right column, you will find the Export menu with options for size, prefix/suffix, and format.

Select SVG from the format drop down for this export.
Then click the “Export” button. It will have the file name populated for you. In this example my file name is “Home1.”

<img style="padding: 0px 15px; float: right" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-Export-Sketch-04.png" alt="no image"/>From here you are prompted to save the export file.
I have a folder specifically for exports and will save it there.

The next step is to drag and drop the SVG file directly into Adobe XD

You also have the option to copy and paste directly from Sketch into Adobe XD. The pasted content remains completely editable.
