We discussed importing images in our last chapter. We are going to revisit the concept and add some additional options for importing content into your designs.

First, let’s look at our basic page design for a real estate app. 

This listing has the address and price but we are missing the listing content and a picture of the home.

Let’s first add the home image to the white rectangle.

<img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:right" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-ImportContent-02.png" alt="no image"/>Adobe XD gives you multiple options for importing content whether images or text.

The first is to use the “import” function in the File menu. 

Once you select Import from the drop down a window will open with your personal files prompting you to select the file you want to import.
