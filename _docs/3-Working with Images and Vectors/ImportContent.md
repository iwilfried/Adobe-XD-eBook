We discussed importing images in our last chapter. We are going to revisit the concept and add some additional options for importing content into your designs.

First, let’s look at our basic page design for a real estate app. 

This listing has the address and price but we are missing the listing content and a picture of the home.

Let’s first add the home image to the white rectangle.

<img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:right" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-ImportContent-02.png" alt="no image"/>Adobe XD gives you multiple options for importing content whether images or text.

The first is to use the “import” function in the File menu. 

Once you select Import from the drop down a window will open with your personal files prompting you to select the file you want to import.

You select the file and click Import.

<img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:left" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-ImportContent-04.png" alt="no image"/>The imported image appears and it is huge—much larger than we need.

I need to use the handles at the corner to resize the image. Hold the Shift key or Control key to keep the proportions.

Now the image is much more manageable and I can easily size it to fit inside the white rectangle in my design.

Next, for the listing content we will use a different approach to importing. 

I have drawn the rectangle where I want the text to appear. I can either drag and drop the text file from my files or copy and paste it from another source.

<img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:right" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-ImportContent-07.png" alt="no image"/>I simply went to my source website and copied this Lorem ipsum text (Command + C or Control + C). 

Then, I return to my Adobe XD file and select the text box. Paste the content by using Command + V (Control + V for Windows users)

The content is larger than the text box so I will need to use a smaller font size.

In this example I switched form 20 point to 15 point text. It looks much better. I can also change the alignment to center, or right or leave it left.
