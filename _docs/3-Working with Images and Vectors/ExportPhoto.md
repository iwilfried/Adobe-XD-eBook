Knowing how to export images from Photoshop into Adobe Experience Design is important for all UI designers. Let’s look at the steps involved with this type of transfer.

The standard copy and paste functions are available from Photoshop to Adobe XD. Let’s look at an example.

<img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:left;" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-Export-Photo-01.png" alt="no image"/>In this window from Photoshop, you can see that I have selected the image I want to transfer and clicked on the Edit menu.
Notice I have the option to “Copy” or “Copy Merged.” If I only want to copy a single layer I will use Copy. Copy Merged will perform the function with multiple layers selected.

Once you click back into Adobe XD you can choose to “Paste” the image.

The image will appear on the pasteboard. My file size is large so I will need to resize the image to fit the artboard
