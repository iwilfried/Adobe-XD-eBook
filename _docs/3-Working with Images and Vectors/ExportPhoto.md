Knowing how to export images from Photoshop into Adobe Experience Design is important for all UI designers. Let’s look at the steps involved with this type of transfer.

&nbsp;   

The standard copy and paste functions are available from Photoshop to Adobe XD. Let’s look at an example.

<img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:left;" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-Export-Photo-01.png" alt="no image"/>In this window from Photoshop, you can see that I have selected the image I want to transfer and clicked on the Edit menu.
Notice I have the option to “Copy” or “Copy Merged.” If I only want to copy a single layer I will use Copy. Copy Merged will perform the function with multiple layers selected.
