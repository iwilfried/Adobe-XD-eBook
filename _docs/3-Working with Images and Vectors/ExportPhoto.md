Knowing how to export images from Photoshop into Adobe Experience Design is important for all UI designers. Letâ€™s look at the steps involved with this type of transfer.

Now, I want you to pay attention to the screen size. There's this Xian one that's 375 by 667, which is what we were working in inside of XD, but if I had an iPhone 6 art board in Photoshop, just this one here, it's 750 by 1334.
In fact, it is double the size of this one, and the reason is that there are twice as many pixels in this screen than there would be in a regular screen so when you're getting ready to export your images for use in XD, you've got to be aware that they have to be made larger, and I'm going to deal with that right now. Okay, so the first thing I want to do is just get rid of this extra art board, so I'm just going to select it in the Layers panel and click the trash can.
It's gone. And I'm going to zoom in here so you can see what I've got. So there's the layout that we've been working on, and there are the layers. Now, if you want to output this whole thing and have it ready for XD, you're going to have to actually be aware that the images and the line art have to be treated a little bit differently.
