Knowing how to export images from Photoshop into Adobe Experience Design is important for all UI designers. Let’s look at the steps involved with this type of transfer.

&nbsp;   

The standard copy and paste functions are available from Photoshop to Adobe XD. Let’s look at an example.

<img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:left;" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-Export-Photo-01.png" alt="no image"/>In this window from Photoshop, you can see that I have selected the image I want to transfer and clicked on the Edit menu.
Notice I have the option to “Copy” or “Copy Merged.” If I only want to copy a single layer I will use Copy. Copy Merged will perform the function with multiple layers selected.

Once you click back into Adobe XD you can choose to “Paste” the image.

&nbsp;   
The image will appear on the pasteboard. My file size is large so I will need to resize the image to fit the artboard

&nbsp;   
Using the handles on the corners of the image I can resize it to fit perfectly inside the artboard.

What if we want the image to fill the entire screen?
 
If we go back to the Start Screen we can see that the artboard options also list the pixel sizes.



Each artboard type has a drop down menu with additional options and size information.

&nbsp;   
If I know I am working with an iPhone 6/7 I know I want the image to be 375 X 667 pixels in order to cover the whole screen.

&nbsp;   
Here is the vertical image I want to use in my design. I resize the image in Photoshop to 357 X 667.
Now I can copy and paste it directly onto my artboard.
