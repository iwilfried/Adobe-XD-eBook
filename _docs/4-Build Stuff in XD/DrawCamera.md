There are a lot of options when it comes to the drawing tools in Adobe XD. You can create numerous elements for your designs.

In this example we are going to create a camera icon.

 <img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:left;" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-Camera-01.png" alt="no image"/>  
 The first step is a simple rectangle with a black fill. We want the edges just slightly rounded so we will want to pull in the handles just a bit to smooth the edges.
