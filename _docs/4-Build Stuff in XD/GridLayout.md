title: Adding Grid Layouts

In this section, we are going to create a grid layout in Adobe XD. Adobe did not add rulers or grids to Experience Design, much to the dismay of most designers. Because of this missing piece you will need a work around. Let’s look at one way to accomplish this.


 <img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:left;" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-GridLayout-01.png" alt="no image"/>  
 
&nbsp;   

Begin by selecting the Web artboard from the Start Screen.

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   

<img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:right;" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-GridLayout-02.png" alt="no image"/>  

&nbsp;   

Next, using the Rectangle tool (R) draw a rectangle that is 1080 pixels high and 1170 pixels wide.



&nbsp;   

<img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:left;" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-GridLayout-03.png" alt="no image"/>  

&nbsp;   

Remove the border and set the fill to a very light gray. Just enough to have it stand out against the background.

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   

<img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:left;" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-GridLayout-04.png" alt="no image"/>  

&nbsp;   

I am going to lock this rectangle in place for the ease of design. 
Use the Object menu > Lock and you will notice a small gray padlock symbol appears on the screen signifying the image is indeed locked.


&nbsp;   

<img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:right;" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-GridLayout-05.png" alt="no image"/>  

&nbsp;   

This step is optional but I know I am going to be moving shapes around and I don’t want to select this one by accident.

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;

 &nbsp;   
 
The next step is to draw another rectangle the same height but much thinner. The width only needs to be 15 pixels.
This is the first of two borders for our grid. Use the fill to give it a gray fill. Let’s duplicate this line by using Command + D and drag the lines to the left and right border of the large rectangle.

&nbsp;   

<img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:right;" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-GridLayout-07.png" alt="no image"/>  

&nbsp;   

Now we have our base rectangle and two slightly darker gray borders.

&nbsp;   

<img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:left;" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-GridLayout-08.png" alt="no image"/>  

&nbsp;   

The next line is also 1080 pixels high but 67.5 pixels wide. 
Change the fill to black with no border.

This black line needs to be directly adjacentt to the left border line we just created. Make sure there isn’t any space between these lines.

&nbsp;   

<img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:left;" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-GridLayout-09.png" alt="no image"/>  

&nbsp;   

With the black line selected, duplicate the shape by using Command + D or by using the Edit menu > Duplicate.
Change the width of this third rectangle to 30 pixels.

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   

<img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:right;" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-GridLayout-10.png" alt="no image"/>  

&nbsp;   

Next, pick a different gray from the border lines and change the fill.

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   

<img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:left;" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-GridLayout-11.png" alt="no image"/> 

&nbsp;   

Push this third line up against the black line. Now all three lines are next to each other without any gaps between them.  


&nbsp;   

<img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:right;" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-GridLayout-12.png" alt="no image"/>  

&nbsp;   

Using the Selection tool (S) and holding down the Shift key you can select multiple shapes.
You want to select the black and gray lines we just created.
  
&nbsp;   

  
<img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:left;" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-GridLayout-13.png" alt="no image"/>  

With these shapes selected click on the Repeat Grid function.
  
&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   
  
<img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:left;" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-GridLayout-14.png" alt="no image"/>
&nbsp;   

A green border appears around the shapes. Pull the green handle to the right to duplicate the series of lines.
Adobe XD automatically includes a padding or gutter in between each set of lines. It is shown in this image as the white space between the gray and black lines.

&nbsp;   

 <img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:right;" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-GridLayout-15.png" alt="no image"/>  

&nbsp;   

If you hover the selection tool over the white padding it turns pink. Now I can adjust the size of the padding by pulling to the left or the right.

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   

<img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:left;" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-GridLayout-16.png" alt="no image"/> 

I do not want any padding between my lines so I pulled the padding until the value in pink read 0. Now I am left with just the black and gray lines.
Next, I will return to the green handle from the Repeat Grid function and pull the lines until they meet the border on the right side.
