Map pins are commonly used in UX/UI design. The icon is often found in most UI kits but it is also extremely easy to create in Adobe XD. If you break the pin icon down it is completely comprised of two circles. Letâ€™s draw our own Map Pin icon in Adobe XD.


 <img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:left;" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-MapPin-01.png" alt="no image"/>  
 Begin by selecting the ellipse tool and drawing a circle while holding down the shift key.

I changed the fill to red.

Next, double click the circle so you can see the paths.
Select the path at the bottom of the circle.
