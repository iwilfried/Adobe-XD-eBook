One of Adobe XD’s most popular features in the Repeat Grid function. Repeat Grid is a feature that can say designers a whole lot of time and hassle. Duplicating items is incredibly simple and if you need to make changes the adjustment is mirrored to every object in the grid. Let’s take a closer look.

The easiest way to do this is to marquee select all the elements by dragging the selection tool over the rectangle and text box. Then in the right properties panel I can click the “Repeat Grid” button. Command + R also works.

These handles are where the action begins. You can pull the handles to the right or left to duplicate things horizontally or pull the lower handle up or down to duplicate vertically.
In this example, I duplicated once horizontally and then vertically twice for a total of 6 squares.  

Now I could change each photograph and name to reflect actual students.

**Editing Elements in a Grid:**  Another great feature to the Repeat Grid function is that if you need to change an element you can do it once and it is reflected throughout the rest of the grid.

In the example below I needed to change the font, so I simply selected one text box in the grid, changed the font and it updated throughout.

The pink space between the rows of avatars is referred to as “padding.” As you hover over this space in a Repeat Grid you will see a double arrow that will allow you to adjust the size of the padding. 
 
The small pink number will change as you adjust. In the example I changed the padding from a value of 20 to 7

**Changing Images in a Grid:** The next step in this project is to add images to the grid. To do this you select the files you want to add, in the order you want them to appear, and then drop them onto one of the images.

Instantly, the images appear in each shape, clipped and centered automatically.

**Adding a Text File to a Grid:** Next, we will add the individual names to each profile picture. To accomplish this you need a text file with each name on a different line. Next, select the shape or object where you’ll be inserting the text; drag and drop the file and watch as the names populate into each space. Remember that the grid will place things in order so make sure the names will line up the way you want them to.

We touched on this earlier when we discussed changing the font. 

Now I will show you how quickly you can change design elements in the grid.
Let’s say you decide the profile pictures need to be in a circle not a square shape.

Select one of the square images and you will notice the blue radius control in the upper right corner. If you drag that control in the image will round into a circle.

This design change will be reflected in all the images in the grid.
