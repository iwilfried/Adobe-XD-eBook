One of Adobe XD’s most popular features in the Repeat Grid function. Repeat Grid is a feature that can say designers a whole lot of time and hassle. Duplicating items is incredibly simple and if you need to make changes the adjustment is mirrored to every object in the grid. Let’s take a closer look.

The easiest way to do this is to marquee select all the elements by dragging the selection tool over the rectangle and text box. Then in the right properties panel I can click the “Repeat Grid” button. Command + R also works.
