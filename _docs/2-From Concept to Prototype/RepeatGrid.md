One of Adobe XD’s most popular features in the Repeat Grid function. Repeat Grid is a feature that can say designers a whole lot of time and hassle. Duplicating items is incredibly simple and if you need to make changes the adjustment is mirrored to every object in the grid. Let’s take a closer look.

The easiest way to do this is to marquee select all the elements by dragging the selection tool over the rectangle and text box. Then in the right properties panel I can click the “Repeat Grid” button. Command + R also works.

These handles are where the action begins. You can pull the handles to the right or left to duplicate things horizontally or pull the lower handle up or down to duplicate vertically.
In this example, I duplicated once horizontally and then vertically twice for a total of 6 squares.  

Now I could change each photograph and name to reflect actual students.

**Editing Elements in a Grid:**  Another great feature to the Repeat Grid function is that if you need to change an element you can do it once and it is reflected throughout the rest of the grid.

In the example below I needed to change the font, so I simply selected one text box in the grid, changed the font and it updated throughout.
