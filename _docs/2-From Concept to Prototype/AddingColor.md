Let’s look at our color options in Adobe XD.

We will begin by changing the background color of our 
“Full Name” placeholder.

**Color Picker:** After selecting the rectangle and clicking “Fill” in the Property Inspector, the color picker menu opens.  

There is a drop down menu at the top where you can choose from solid colors or gradient colors.  

Let’s begin with gradient colors.

**Gradient Editor:** If Gradient is selected in the drop down, then the Gradient Editor appears.  

You can click along the Gradient Editor to place color stops. Select your colors using the color picker.   

You can place additional color stops by clicking along the Gradient Editor. You can also change the color of the color stops by clicking directly on the color stop and selecting a different color.   

You can also change the color of the stops by moving them along the Gradient Editor. To move them, simply click and drag. You can move from one color stop to another by using the Tab key.  

If you want to delete a color stop you can drag it off the Gradient Editor.

This is how our placeholder will look with the gradient selections in our example.

You can adjust the gradient by moving the color stops along the Gradient Editor.  

All changes are reflected immediately.
