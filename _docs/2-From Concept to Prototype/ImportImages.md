Adding images in Adobe XD is simple and you have multiple options available:    

- In Adobe XD, click File > Import, and browse to select the file.
- Drag-and-drop, or copy and paste the image into Adobe XD from Finder or a web browser.  

<img style="padding: 0px 15px; float: left" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-ImportImage-01.png
" alt="no image"/>

&nbsp;   

Drag and Drop: First, draw the shape or select the area where the image will be placed.

&nbsp;   

Find the image in your files and drag it directly into the space in Adobe XD.

The image is immediately clipped and scaled into place.

You can also drag images directly from a web browser onto your artboard or into an object. Like the example above, the image size is automatically adjusted to fit inside the object.  

You can also copy and paste images from web browsers into Adobe XD.

**Applying Masks to Imported Images:** You can also place an image on an artboard and mask it with a shape.

First import the file to your artboard. Then draw or place the desired shape over the image.

You can adjust the proportion of the shape until you have the exact shape you are looking for.

Object >Mask with Shape 
This will crop the image to fit within the circle shape.

**Importing Multiple Files:** In Adobe XD you can import more than one image at a time. This is a wonderful, timesaving option.

In this example we have an artboard with 4 equal squares. We created these squares using the Repeat Grid function. (Details in another section)

Select the shapes you are using and open your files. When you select the files keep in mind that the order in which you select them is the order they will be placed.
