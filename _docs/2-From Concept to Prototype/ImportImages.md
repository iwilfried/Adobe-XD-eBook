Adding images in Adobe XD is simple and you have multiple options available:    

- In Adobe XD, click File > Import, and browse to select the file.
- Drag-and-drop, or copy and paste the image into Adobe XD from Finder or a web browser.  

<img style="padding: 0px 15px; float: left" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-ImportImage-01.png
" alt="no image"/>

&nbsp;   

Drag and Drop: First, draw the shape or select the area where the image will be placed.

" alt="no image"/>  

&nbsp;   

Find the image in your files and drag it directly into the space in Adobe XD.

The image is immediately clipped and scaled into place.

You can also drag images directly from a web browser onto your artboard or into an object. Like the example above, the image size is automatically adjusted to fit inside the object.  

You can also copy and paste images from web browsers into Adobe XD.

**Applying Masks to Imported Images:** You can also place an image on an artboard and mask it with a shape.

First import the file to your artboard. Then draw or place the desired shape over the image.
