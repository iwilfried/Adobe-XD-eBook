Adding blur effects to your design can accomplish a lot visually and functionally.  Blurring objects can force the reader’s eye to focus on what the designer feels is important.

It can provide an aesthetic feel or provide continuity in design without compromising readability. Blur should be used wisely though. It can be distracting if overused.
