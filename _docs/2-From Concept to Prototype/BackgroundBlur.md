Adding blur effects to your design can accomplish a lot visually and functionally.  Blurring objects can force the reader’s eye to focus on what the designer feels is important.

It can provide an aesthetic feel or provide continuity in design without compromising readability. Blur should be used wisely though. It can be distracting if overused.


Let’s look closer at the blur effect options in Adobe XD.

We will look at Object Blur first.

**Object Blur:** In this example we are creating the title page for our online student portal. First, we create a new artboard. Next, we drag and drop the image file onto the artboard. We have chosen a stock image of a university library from freepik.com for our cover image.

After placing the image, I select it and choose Object Blur from the drop down menu.

Now, I can adjust the level of blur using the slider below.

**Background Blur:** This same effect can be achieved using the Background Blur option but with a few additional steps.

I will create another artboard and place the image file just like we did in the first example.

Next, select the Rectangle tool and draw a rectangle the exact shape of your image.

With the rectangle selected and the box next to Background Blur checked we can now adjust the Blur Amount, Brightness and Opacity to achieve the same look as we did using Object Blur

Let’s go back to our student profiles artboard. For the sake of our example, let’s say we need to blur one of the student’s profile images. We can do that with Background Blur. Simply select the image, tick the box next to Background Blur and adjust the Blur Amount, Brightness, and Opacity until you reach the desired effect
