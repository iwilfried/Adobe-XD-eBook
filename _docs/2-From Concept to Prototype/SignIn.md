Now that we have the background image in place and properly blurred, we can now turn our attention to the username password and sign in areas. Now the plan here is to not go with the boxes unless we need one and instead replace it with a key line, a very thin one-pixel line underlining the username which will be a email address. So we're going to create a little mail icon for right here. We're going to add a lock icon here for the password. And this here, the sign in, we're actually going to turn into a ghost button.

Now a ghost button is an invisible button with a stroke around it and it's real easy to do. So what you do is you just select that background right there, that strip, and you turn off the fill but you just give it a white border. And if you take a look at it, there it is, there's your ghost button.

Now the other thing you might want to do is make sure that these two items are aligned with each other. So I'm going to just click the horizontal and vertical alignment to make sure that they're aligned. And then I'm going to take both items here and I'm going to group them and by doing that, I can now move them as one unit.
And there we go, I've got it perfectly aligned with the center of the screen. Okay, let's turn our attention to the username here. So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to get rid of this box and then I'm going to select the line tool right here, and I'm just going to hold down the Shift key as I drag to constrain the motion. And I'm going to look for that guide, there it is, there's the smart guide, so in the width here, and then all I have to do is just change that to white and it looks pretty good.

Okay, and we're going to do the same thing with the password. Now here's a really interesting little technique. Let's just get rid of the box.And you just click on the line. Click, hold down your Option Alt key to make a copy. Hold down the Shift key to come down straight and there we go, we got the username and password done. Now we're going to create the little icon for the username which will be an email address.So we're going to make ourselves an envelope.

So we're going to select the rectangle tool and we're just going to draw a rectangle, doesn't matter how big it is right now. And we're not going to give it a border so we're going to turn off the border on it and then we'll add a stroke there. Okay, there's a line there, and we'll go to the other opposite corner and add another line. And then we'll just select all the lines and the box and we're going to group them, Command or Control + G.
And then we can just take the icon and shrink it down in size and then we can just bring it down and place it right about there and make sure that it's lined up, good. Okay, so the password needs a lock. So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to go up to the File menu, select Import, and go find that Lock.svg image in our Chapter Two download folder and select it, Import, and it appears on the screen.

And then I can select it. Sometimes you grab what you don't want. And just move it into position, you notice I've got my smart guides there, so now what I want to do is just move it into place. So I'm going to select it and using the down arrow, I'm just going to try and line it up roughly with the baseline of the word Password. And we now have the lock icon in place. So there you go, there's creating the page that we use for sign in and we've created a logo here just using the rectangle tool and a couple of lines and we made a ghost button just by basically taking a rectangle with a rounded corners and did not giving it a fill and a simple stroke.
