**Wireframes:** Wireframes are the basic blueprint for your design. Utilizing a wireframe will help with structure and layout as well as functionality for on-screen design. Wireframes can be low-fidelity, super simple, black and white, with filler content while others are hi-fidelity, with actual content, style, typeface and some graphic designs included. 

Adobe XD provides UI kits that can give designers a huge jumpstart with wireframe design. If you don’t use one of the UI kits you will need to know how to create a wireframe from scratch.

**Wireframe design:** Begin with grids. Using grids will keep your design aligned and consistent. The next step is to think through your app’s general flow. What is the first screen your user will see?

Generally speaking, an app will need a welcome screen, a sign in or sign up screen, a search screen, a profile screen etc. Our example will start with a Sign Up screen and a Profile Screen.

First, you need to open and name an artboard and make sure to add gridlines.
Next, create a header for your prototype. You need to open and name an artboard and make sure to add gridlines.

In this example, the header has the app title, a hamburger menu and a search icon. The menu and search icon were made with the line tool and ellipse tool. Don’t worry, we go into detail on how to create these icons in another section.

After designing the hamburger menu and search icon we grouped the elements (command + G). You could always make them into symbols as well.

Now I can copy this master screen for each additional artboard.

If I add another element that will be universal to all screens I will update the master screen.

Let's begin designing and adding elements to the artboard. The wireframe is, like the name says, the framework that shows where elements will go further along in the development process.
