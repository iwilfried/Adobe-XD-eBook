**Wireframes:** Wireframes are the basic blueprint for your design. Utilizing a wireframe will help with structure and layout as well as functionality for on-screen design. Wireframes can be low-fidelity, super simple, black and white, with filler content while others are hi-fidelity, with actual content, style, typeface and some graphic designs included. 

Adobe XD provides UI kits that can give designers a huge jumpstart with wireframe design. If you don’t use one of the UI kits you will need to know how to create a wireframe from scratch.

**Wireframe design:** Begin with grids. Using grids will keep your design aligned and consistent. The next step is to think through your app’s general flow. What is the first screen your user will see?

Generally speaking, an app will need a welcome screen, a sign in or sign up screen, a search screen, a profile screen etc. Our example will start with a Sign Up screen and a Profile Screen.
