" alt="no image"/>After clicking the “Share Online” symbol a menu appears. At the top you are asked to give this file a title.

Below the title there is a box with a dashed line. This box will be the icon for your file. You can drag and drop an image file directly to this space. It will be cropped and placed for you. The recommended image size to display on web or mobile is 120 X 120.

Next, you will see the Home Button icon next to the words “Start at.”  Make sure the correct artboard is selected as your start screen.
