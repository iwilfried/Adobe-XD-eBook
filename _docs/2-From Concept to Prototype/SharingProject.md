Adobe XD has a wonderful sharing feature built in. Let’s look at how to share your prototype preview.
 
Share Online: Adobe XD provides multiple choices for sharing your design or prototype with others. We will look first at sharing online through creating a link.

Below the title there is a box with a dashed line. This box will be the icon for your file. You can drag and drop an image file directly to this space. It will be cropped and placed for you. The recommended image size to display on web or mobile is 120 X 120.

Next, you will see the Home Button icon next to the words “Start at.”  Make sure the correct artboard is selected as your start screen.

The next line has a box and the words “Allow Comments.” This is very important! If you want comments from the people you send this file to, make sure the box is checked.  

When you have finished you can click “Create Link.”

**Copy Link:** This is the next box you will see. The link is is auto populated and you can copy and paste the link into an email or other form of electronic communication.

Now your team members or stakeholders can view and comment on your design.

In this example, I named the prototype file and added an icon image. Now, I am ready to share my link. 
 
**Update Link:** During the iteration process there will probably be multiple changes or adjustments made. If so, you can easily update the link to the current version of your design by clicking the “Update Link” button.

**New Link:** If you don’t want to update the current link and you prefer to create an entirely new link you can select that option as well and a new URl is created.
