Grids are useful in layout organization. They improve clarity and consistency throughout the design. Using grids helps with alignment of objects as well as text.

Adobe XD has the option to show grids on any of your artboards. The process is simple. Select your artboard and check the box under Grid in the Property Inspector menu.

The default color is gray and the pixel size is 8. You can change both of these options easily.

Maybe the gray is difficult for you to see or maybe you really like pink, either way you have the option to change the color using the color dialog box.

If you want to change the density of the grid or the size of the pixels you can adjust that value on the line next to the square box. The smaller the number, the smaller or more dense the grid.   

In my example below I used the value of 50. If you like this size and think you will use it regularly you can make it the default value by clicking the “Make Default” button below.

Once you have the grid size and color set you can begin design work. The nice thing about grids is they will “snap” objects into place. After drawing this rectangle, when I move it within the artboard the grid pulls it into alignment.

If you need to move your object or text outside the grid lines you and hold down the Option key can you can move the object freely along the artboard.
