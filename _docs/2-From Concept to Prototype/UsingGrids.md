Grids are useful in layout organization. They improve clarity and consistency throughout the design. Using grids helps with alignment of objects as well as text.

Adobe XD has the option to show grids on any of your artboards. The process is simple. Select your artboard and check the box under Grid in the Property Inspector menu.
