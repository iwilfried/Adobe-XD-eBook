Drawing with Adobe XD is all about shapes. When you want to create an image you need to look at it and break it down to its simplest form. Take the “Search Icon” for example, it is made up of a circle and a line.  That’s it! Let’s create this popular icon.  

<img style="padding: 0px 15px; float: left" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-CreateSearch-01.png
" alt="no image"/>Select the Ellipse tool from the left menu. Remember that you can hold the Shift key to maintain proportion (ALT on PC). 

Draw a small circle. By default the circle will have a fill. In this particular example, we don’t want the fill so I’m going to uncheck that box.
 
<img style="padding: 0px 15px; float: right" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-CreateSearch-01.png
" alt="no image"/>Next, we want to change the border to white. The Hex code you want is FFFFFF.  

Then we need to thicken the border so it looks like a magnifying glass. Finally, change the Stroke value to 3.
