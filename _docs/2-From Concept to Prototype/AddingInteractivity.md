After you’ve completed the design phase it’s time to add interactions between screens. With Adobe XD this is incredibly quick and easy. Interactions include how your app flows, transitions between screens, and the overall user experience.

The user interface in Prototype mode is very simplistic. The design tools and property inspector disappear because the design phase is over. Don’t worry, you can always switch back to complete iterations.

The Home Screen is the first thing a user will see when they open your app.

If I want to change the Home Screen the process is also very simple.

If you click that gray home symbol the new screen becomes the Home screen.
