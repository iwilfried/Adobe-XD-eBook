title: Adding Interactivity to a XD Project
category: 2-From Concept to Prototype

After you’ve completed the design phase it’s time to add interactions between screens. With Adobe XD this is incredibly quick and easy. Interactions include how your app flows, transitions between screens, and the overall user experience.

The user interface in Prototype mode is very simplistic. The design tools and property inspector disappear because the design phase is over. Don’t worry, you can always switch back to complete iterations.

" alt="no image"/>**Set the Home Screen:** In Prototype mode a screen is assigned as the Home Screen and that is indicated by the blue house tab on the side of the screen.

The Home Screen is the first thing a user will see when they open your app.

If I want to change the Home Screen the process is also very simple.

" alt="no image"/>If I want the Table of Contents screen to be the Home screen I simply select the artboard, it is highlighted in blue, and the home symbol appears in gray. 

If you click that gray home symbol the new screen becomes the Home screen.

Begin by selecting the “Get Started” button. You will see a blue arrow on the side of the selected object.  

<img style="padding: 0px 15px; float:left" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-Add-Inter-05.png
" alt="no image"/>Drag that handle to the target artboard, in this case that is the Table of Contents screen. This blue line is referred to as a wire.


You can also use the “Target” drop down to select the artboard you want.

You are also given options for the type of transition and the duration. We will go over this more below.

Now when someone clicks the Get Started button they are connected to the Table of Contents

&nbsp; 

**Target:** The first drop down in “Target.” This will list all the artboards in your design. This is extremely helpful when you have two hundred artboards and dragging the connecting handle is not feasible.
If I was connecting a back button I could select the “Previous Artboard” option. This does what it says—it goes back to the previous artboard.

" alt="no image"/>**Transition:** Adobe XD gives you numerous transition options. 
You can choose from Dissolve, Slide (in multiple directions), or Push (in multiple directions)

" alt="no image"/>**Easing:** Easing indicates the speed at which the screen transitions from one to another.

Ease in starts slow but accelerates and Ease out does the opposite—Starts quickly but slows down.

Ease In-Out is a combination of both. The transition starts slow, accelerates and then slows down again.

" alt="no image"/>**Duration:**  The total time it takes to complete one cycle or transition. 

Now we can continue making connections. I know that when someone clicks on “Appetizers” I want them to navigate to the “Appetizer” screen so I make that connection. Next, I do the same with “Entrees.” You can see below how each interaction looks in the Prototype mode. You can press Command + A to see all interactions in the prototype.

If you decide to remove an interaction, all you do is take the wire and drag it off the artboard onto an empty space and it disappears. Very easy.
 
As you can imagine, a prototype with hundreds of artboards can become pretty complex, but Adobe XD has done a fabulous job of simplifying what used to be a complicated process. You simply drag wires to connect elements and specify transition style. That is interactivity simplified!
