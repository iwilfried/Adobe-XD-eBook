<img style="padding: 0px 15px; float: left" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-Share-01.png" alt="no image" />Adobe XD has some powerful options when it comes to sharing your prototype preview with others.
When you click on the “Share Online” icon a menu appears.  

From here you want to name your file.  

You can also see next to the small house icon it states the preview will “Start at Cover” which is our home screen.  

Then, decide whether or not you’d like to allow comments on the prototype. Either check the box or leave it blank.  

Next, add an image for the app icon. You can drag the image from your files into the small square in the share online menu.  
 
After adding the app icon you can click **Create Link**.

The system will generate a link that can be copied into any browser for online viewing.

Once your team members or stakeholders view the prototype and navigate its pages they can add comments directly to the prototype. This is only possible if you selected “Allow Comments” in the original share menu.

In this example, John Smith has requested that the restaurant contact info and address be added to this page. I can resolve this issue and send him an updated link so he can view the changes.
