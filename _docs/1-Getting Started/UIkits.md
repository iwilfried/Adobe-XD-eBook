Adobe XD provides UI Kits for iOS, Google and Microsoft. UI Kits, or User Interface Kits, are a collection of components you can add to your prototype design. UI Kits are usually made up of key elements you will use in most every design including, screens, slideshows, buttons, navigation etc. By utilizing UI Kits you will save time and improve your productivity.

Access the UI KIts from the Start Screen or from the File menu:

I will select the Search screen and add it to my design. This is a simple copy (Command + C) and paste (Command + V) step.

In order to work on the individual pieces it will help to zoom in on the screen. Highlight the search screen and in the View menu select “Zoom to Selection.”
Now you can click on individual elements and adjust their appearance. 
In this example I changed the search bar fill from gray to brown and I increased the size of the “Search” text.
