**Start Screen:** Consider the start screen as Adobe XD’s “homebase.” It’s the first screen you see after launching the program and the last screen you see after closing a file.  
From the start screen you can access design presets for both Apple and Android phones and tablets, as well as web and custom sizes.  
Keep in mind, there have been multiple updates to Adobe XD so the layout of your Start Screen may vary slightly from the image below.
