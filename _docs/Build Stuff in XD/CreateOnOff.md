Currently, Adobe XD does not have actual motion capabilities, but we can simulate motion using the transition options in the prototype mode.

Iâ€™m going to show you how to create a simple On/Off switch and mimic the motion of the button sliding from on to off.

  

 <img style="padding: 0px 15px;float:right;" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-SwitchOnOff-01.png" alt="no image"/> Begin by drawing a rectangle on your artboard.
My rectangle is 48 pixels wide and 24 pixels high.
