The properties panel is found on the right side of the Adobe XD interface.

When you select an object within your design a blue square appears and your property options are displayed in the properties panel.

**Alignment:** The first three alignment options are Align Top, Middle and Bottom. Next to that is Align Left, Center and Right.

**The Repeat Grid** is a powerful feature that requires its own dedicated section. Refer to section 2.10 for detailed instruction on using Repeat Grid.

**Boolean Operations:** You are given four options for creating a compound design out of two shapes by using the following functions:


**Add** (Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + U)
**Subtract** (Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + S)
**Intersect** (Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + I)
**Exclude Overlap** (Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + X)  


Width and height can also be adjusted in this panel. If you want to lock the aspect ratio be sure to click on the small lock symbol. The X and Y positions can also be adjusted here.
