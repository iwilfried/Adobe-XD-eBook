The properties panel is found on the right side of the Adobe XD interface.

When you select an object within your design a blue square appears and your property options are displayed in the properties panel.

<img style="padding: 0px 15px; float: left" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-Property-Panel-01.png" alt="no image" />All options above the “Appearance” section are labeled in the figure to the left.


**Alignment:** The first three alignment options are Align Top, Middle and Bottom. Next to that is Align Left, Center and Right.

**The Repeat Grid** is a powerful feature that requires its own dedicated section. Refer to section 2.10 for detailed instruction on using Repeat Grid.

**Boolean Operations:** You are given four options for creating a compound design out of two shapes by using the following functions:


**Add** (Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + U)
**Subtract** (Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + S)
**Intersect** (Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + I)
**Exclude Overlap** (Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + X)

Width and height can also be adjusted in this panel. If you want to lock the aspect ratio be sure to click on the small lock symbol. The X and Y positions can also be adjusted here.  
Once you select an image on your artboard you are given options to adjust how it looks. Let’s focus on the area under “appearance.” The first slider is for the image’s opacity. 


<img style="padding: 0px 15px; float: left" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-Property-Panel-02.png" alt="no image" />**Opacity:** By adjusting the slider to the left the percentage of opacity changes.
If I want a softer, more subtle image I can change the opacity to 48%. 
You can see the image has become more transparent.

<img style="padding: 0px 15px; float: left" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-Property-Panel-03.png" alt="no image" />**Corner Radius:** Below opacity is two options to adjust the corner radius. 

The first button shows the entire square highlighted to indicate all corners will have the same radius.

In my example I changed the radius on all corners to 75. You can see the rounded edges.

If I didn’t want a uniform look I would use the second option that shows all four corners separately. 

In my example I set to opposite corners to 75. The small image highlights the corner you are working with in blue.




Fill: Changing the fill color is extremely easy with Adobe XD. 

After checking the box next to fill and selecting the dropper image you are given a large circle where you can select the exact pixel color you are looking for.





Border: Changing the border color is similar to fill. 

First you select the image you want to add the border to, then you click on the dropper to choose the color.

Next, you add the value for the weight of the border.


I chose to match the border to the color of the fork in the logo. Then I changed the weight to a value of ten.



Shadow: Adding a shadow can make a big difference to the appearance of your object.

You can add values for the shadow in the X position, and Y position and then the “B” stands for the blur of the shadow.





Blur: If you click the box next to Background Blur, three sliders appear.

You can adjust Blur amount, Brightness and Effect Opacity









The dropdown arrow next to Background Blur gives you the option to adjust Object Blur.



 
 
Text Properties: When I select the text box  “Fine Fast Food”  you can see the area is highlighted in blue. 



Now the properties panel displays options for Font type, size and style as well as alignment, character spacing and line spacing.
The appearance options remain the same, opacity, fill, border, shadow and background blur.
