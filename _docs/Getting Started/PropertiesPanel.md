The properties panel is found on the right side of the Adobe XD interface.

When you select an object within your design a blue square appears and your property options are displayed in the properties panel.

<img style="padding: 0px 15px; float: left" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-Property-Panel-01.png" alt="no image" />All options above the “Appearance” section are labeled in the figure to the left.


**Alignment:** The first three alignment options are Align Top, Middle and Bottom. Next to that is Align Left, Center and Right.

**The Repeat Grid** is a powerful feature that requires its own dedicated section. Refer to section 2.10 for detailed instruction on using Repeat Grid.

**Boolean Operations:** You are given four options for creating a compound design out of two shapes by using the following functions:


**Add** (Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + U)
**Subtract** (Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + S)
**Intersect** (Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + I)
**Exclude Overlap** (Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + X)

Width and height can also be adjusted in this panel. If you want to lock the aspect ratio be sure to click on the small lock symbol. The X and Y positions can also be adjusted here.  
Once you select an image on your artboard you are given options to adjust how it looks. Let’s focus on the area under “appearance.” The first slider is for the image’s opacity. 


Opacity: By adjusting the slider to the left the percentage of opacity changes.
If I want a softer, more subtle image I can change the opacity to 48%. 
You can see the image has become more transparent.
