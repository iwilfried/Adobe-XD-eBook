In the course of a design project you will use some images and/or elements over and over. A timesaving tip is to add that image or element as a symbol. This way you can insert it into your design without having to re-create it.
Create a Symbol: There are multiple ways to create a symbol in Adobe XD:  

Option 1: Select the object and click + in the Symbols library.  

Option 2: Select the object and press Command + K (on Mac), 
or Ctrl + K (on Windows).  

Option 3: Right-click the object and select “Make Symbol.”  

Option 4: For Mac users, select the object then use the Object menu > Make Symbol.

Symbol Library: Once you have added a symbol it will be displayed in the Symbol library in the upper left hand corner of the interface.  

<img style="padding: 0px 15px; float: left" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-Symbol-02.png" alt="no image" />All the symbols you’ve added to the current project will show in the library.

You can open the Symbols library in three ways:  
Press Command + Shift + Y (on Mac), or Ctrl + Shift + Y (on Windows)

<img style="padding: 0px 35px" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-Symbol-03.png" alt="no image" />Click  in the left toolbar 




For Mac users, use the View menu > Symbol library.





Editing Symbols: If you need to edit a symbol keep in mind that the changes will affect every symbol throughout your project.

Double click the symbol to select it and begin editing. Once selected, the symbol will have a thick border around it. Now you can edit the appearance of the symbol just like any other object. As shown below, all three instances reflect the changes.


















If you need to edit an individual symbol and you do not want the changes to affect the rest of the instances you can right click on the symbol and ungroup it from the series.

This will allow you to make changes only to the selected symbol.





In my example below, I ungrouped the selected symbol and created a thick brown border. You can see it did not affect the symbol in the Symbol library or in the adjacent artboard.














Using Symbols: Using the symbols in your design is as easy as dragging it into place. From the Symbol library, simply select the symbol you want and drag it to the artboard. You can also copy and paste the symbol from one artboard to another. 

Symbols can be identified by the green outline that appears when you hover over the object.
