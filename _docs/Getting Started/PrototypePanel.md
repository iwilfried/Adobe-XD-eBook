**Prototype Mode:** When you switch from Design mode to Prototype mode the interface changes. The tool and property panels disappear. Thatâ€™s because the purpose of Prototype mode is to coordinate the interaction between artboards. 
It also gives you the ability to preview that interaction and share it online, in real time, with other team members or stakeholders. Being able to preview what users will experience when using your app or website is invaluable.
