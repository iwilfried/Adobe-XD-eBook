**Prototype Mode:** When you switch from Design mode to Prototype mode the interface changes. The tool and property panels disappear. That’s because the purpose of Prototype mode is to coordinate the interaction between artboards. 
It also gives you the ability to preview that interaction and share it online, in real time, with other team members or stakeholders. Being able to preview what users will experience when using your app or website is invaluable.

If the screen has been selected as the Home screen the tab with the house icon will be blue.  

All other tabs will be grayed out until they are selected.

The house icon is grayed out and there is one blue handle on the side of the artboard.

You can control the visual experience with these transition options. Will the screen slide up or push over? Will the transition be immediate or will it be slower?  Spend some time customizing the look and feel of your app’s user experience
