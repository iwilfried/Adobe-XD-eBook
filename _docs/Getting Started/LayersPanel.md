These icons include familiar objects like folders, text, images, shapes, etc. It also includes boolean operations, masked groups and, new to Adobe XD, repeat grids.

If there are nested elements below the parent icon the icon will be filled in or solid. If there are no further elements, than the icon will be a simple line object.
