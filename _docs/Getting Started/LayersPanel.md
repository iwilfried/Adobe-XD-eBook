Choose the single artboard you want to work with and double click the artboard icon. 

Instantly the screen pans and zooms in on your chosen artboard. 

All the layers for that particular artboard are listed in the left column.

<img style="padding: 0px 15px; float: right" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-Layers-02.png" alt="no image" />**Layers Panel Icons:** Each element in the artboard is represented by an icon in the Layers Panel. These icons include familiar objects like folders, text, images, shapes, etc. It also includes boolean operations, masked groups and, new to Adobe XD, repeat grids.

If there are nested elements below the parent icon the icon will be filled in or solid. If there are no further elements, than the icon will be a simple line object.
