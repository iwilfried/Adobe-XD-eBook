Previewing your design on a desktop is helpful but not nearly as invaluable as mobile device previews. Designers need to see how the prototype looks and performs on an actual mobile device.

With the use of the XD app you can preview and test your XD designs, interactions and transitions live on actual devices. 

Your device must be connected by a USB cable for this function to work.

Once connected, Adobe XD will identify what type of device is connected and ready for the preview.
