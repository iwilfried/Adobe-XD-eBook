It’s time to get started. Let’s get familiar with the Adobe XD interface. From the Start Screen, choose a file preset. My examples will be based on the iPhone 6/7.

Once you’ve selected a preset, a window opens immediately. Here is your blank slate, or your interface. It’s clean and surprisingly straightforward.

On the left side you’ll see a column of tools. The selection tool, rectangle tool, an ellipse tool, line tool, pen tool and text tool. Each tool has a shortcut. If you forget what the keyboard shortcut is hover your mouse over the tool symbol and it will be displayed.

Below the text tool is the artboard tool. Use this tool to add artboards to your project. Each screen in your project will be a separate artboard. The last tool in the section is the zoom tool. Use the zoom tool to zoom in and out of the screen.

At the very bottom of the left tool bar are the symbol and layers tools. &nbsp;The symbol tool allows you to create “symbols” from icons or elements you will use multiple times throughout the project. If you have a menu bar that will be consistent throughout your design add that as a symbol. If you make edits to the symbol it is updated in every location that symbol appears.
