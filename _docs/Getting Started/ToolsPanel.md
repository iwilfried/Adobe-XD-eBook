Adobe XD - Tool Panel
Don’t be fooled by Adobe XD’s simplified
interface. This software is powerful despite its
streamlined set of tools.  

As mentioned previously, the **Tool panel** is
found on the left column.  

The tools are the Selection tool (V), the
Rectangle tool (R), Ellipse tool (E), Line tool (L),
Pen tool (P), Text tool (T), Artboard tool (A) and
Zoom tool (Z).  

I have listed the keyboard shortcut for each tool
above. They are pretty self explanatory but if you
forget you can hover over the icon and the
shortcut is displayed.  


Let’s begin by creating an artboard. Click on the artboard tool or
push the letter A. The menu will appear giving you numerous
choices for screen sizes including, Apple, Google, Microsoft and
Web options.

Select the size you need and
give your artboard a name.

Rectangle tool: Use the Rectangle tool to draw squares and rectangles. In the right
column you can set the properties for the rectangle. Set the width and the height,
and the X and Y position. I set it to 300 X 200 in the example below. You can also
click the small lock symbol to lock the rectangle. This will keep the shape in
proportion during scale changes.
I rotated this rectangle 90°, you can see this value on the right side.
The outer white handles can resize the shape as well. This
is a functionality also found in Photoshop and Illustrator. A
new feature is the inner handle shown to the left highlighted
in blue. If you select that handle and pull it toward the
center of the shape you will evenly round all edges.
By holding down the option or alt key I can select just one
corner to reshape.
Another nice, time saving tool in Adobe XD.
You can make quick work of reshaping this rectangle by
double clicking on each circle or anchor point. It will
change the rounded rectangle into sharp points.
There are endless options here and the design aspects of
Adobe XD are impressive. By double clicking on the
rectangle (or any shape for that matter) the lines become
editable paths. Use these quick steps to create custom
designs in no time.
Use these shapes for design elements like icons, buttons,
masks etc.
Ellipse tool: The Ellipse tool draws circles and ovals. You
can draw freehand or you can constrain the image by
holding down the Shift key. This will give you a perfect
circle. The Shift key can be used in this manner for
rectangles and other shapes as well.
Line tool: Use the Line tool to draw straight lines. While
drawing your line, hold the shift key and Adobe XD will
automatically adjust the line in 15° increments. Adjust the
thickness of the line using the stroke. Adjust the
appearance with the color, fill, shadow, and opacity, etc.
Pen tool: The Pen tool functions just like it does in
Illustrator and Photoshop. With each click you place
anchor points along the shape. If you want to leave the
path open simply click the Escape key. If you want to close
the path you click back on the first anchor point. You can
continue to manipulate the paths and edit the shape using
the Selection tool.
Text tool. If you select the Text tool you can click
anywhere on the artboard to begin typing. By
default the text will appear horizontally but it will not
wrap to a new line.
You can move the words on top of existing shapes
and it will appear as long as it is a layer above the
shape. If you want the text to fit within an existing
shape, select the Text tool, and drag the cursor to
create a text box that fills exactly the space where
you want the text to appear.
There are three text box examples in the image to
the left.
Font characteristics, size, and appearance can be
changed in the Properties panel on the right.
The Artboard tool was already covered at the beginning of this section. The next tool
is the Zoom tool. The functionality is obvious but there are some tips and tricks you
may not be aware of.
The Zoom tool: Working on small objects can be a difficult
task. Thankfully, we have the Zoom to to assist us when
working with small shapes or elements.
I created artboard three and added a tiny blue square. I have
three options for zooming in to view this shape.
1) I can click on the zoom tool. The cursor turns into a
magnifying glass and I can right click to increase the
magnification.
2) I can use the Zoom drop-down menu in the upper right
corner of the screen. I am given preset values of 25% -
400% or I can type in a custom value.
3) Use the View menu. By using the View menu I
have additional helpful options at my disposal.
You can still see my small blue square on artboard
three to the left. Let’s explore some powerful options
found in the View menu.
Zoom To Fit All will adjust to
show all my artboards within this
project.
If you have a project with 100
artboards you can imagine what
this screen might look like.
Zoom To Selection will
zoom in on only the
selected shape.
Notice the zoom value on
the right shows 2643.5%
Now that is a zoom!
You can see how
beneficial this is when
working with smaller
objects.
