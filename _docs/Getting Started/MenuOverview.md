The first three options are standard (New, Open & Open Recent). The fourth option “Open UI Kit” is exactly the same option we saw on XD’s start screen.

If you select “Open UI Kit” you have the option of further selecting Apple, Google or Microsoft. From there you are given a choice of multiple UI elements that you can add to your design. Below are examples of what you find in the Apple IOS kit. 
 
Select the options you want and paste them directly into your design.

Back to the file menu, below UI Kits are more standard selections. Close, Save and Save As all work as you would expect. If you select “Export” you will be prompted to select design, web, iOS or Android, resolution for Retina display and directory, where you want to save the files.
