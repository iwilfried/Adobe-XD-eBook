Previously we gave you a general overview of the Adobe XD interface. Now, let’s dig in a bit more and look at each menu and it’s options.

The first three options are standard (New, Open & Open Recent). The fourth option “Open UI Kit” is exactly the same option we saw on XD’s start screen.

If you select “Open UI Kit” you have the option of further selecting Apple, Google or Microsoft. From there you are given a choice of multiple UI elements that you can add to your design. Below are examples of what you find in the Apple IOS kit. 
 
Select the options you want and paste them directly into your design.

Back to the file menu, below UI Kits are more standard selections. Close, Save and Save As all work as you would expect. If you select “Export” you will be prompted to select design, web, iOS or Android, resolution for Retina display and directory, where you want to save the files.

Choose whichever applies to your project.

Below Export is Import and we will go over that later.

The next option is **Share Online.**

This is a common option in XD and one that is available on the main interface.

<img style="padding: 0px 15px; float: right" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-Menu-Mac-04.png" alt="no image" height="420px"/>If you select “**Share Online**” from the drop down menu it will open the share window from the interface.
 
The last option on the file menu is “**Manage Shared Links.**” If you select this option you are linked to your “assets” file within your Creative Cloud account.

If you compare the size of the Edit Menu in Photoshop to XD it’s considerably larger. XD is simplified yet still very powerful. Many of the functions you find in Photoshop’s Edit Menu are found on the main interface within the right properties column.

The last item in the first list is “Repeat Grid.” This quickly became one of my favorite tools.

You can access the Repeat Grid function from the right panel on main screen as well. We will discuss this tool in depth later.

You can also manipulate Paths, add Text, Arrange objects and Align to a pixel grid if you've got the grid turned on, and the Align and Distribute.


Again, these functions are also available in the main XD interface.

<img style="padding: 0px 15px; float: left" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-Menu-Mac-06.png" alt="no image" height="420px"/>Use the View menu to Zoom in and out. “Zoom to Selection” is going to zero in on the artboard that is selected. If you choose “Zoom to Fit All” XD will include all of your artboards and at once. 

You have further options to view Full Screen, Switch your Workspace, access the Symbol Library, and view Layers.

The last two menus are the Window menu and the Help menu.

The Window menu is pretty simple. Another “Preview” link is available in addition to the function at the top right menu on the main interface.
