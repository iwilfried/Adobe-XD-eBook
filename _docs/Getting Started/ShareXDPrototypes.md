<img style="padding: 0px 15px; float: left" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-Share-01.png" alt="no image" />Adobe XD has some powerful options when it comes to sharing your prototype preview with others.
When you click on the “Share Online” icon a menu appears.  
From here you want to name your file.  
You can also see next to the small house icon it states the preview will “Start at Cover” which is our home screen.  
Then, decide whether or not you’d like to allow comments on the prototype. Either check the box or leave it blank.
