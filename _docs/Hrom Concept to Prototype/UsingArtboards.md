Artboards are the foundation of your prototype design. Generally, every artboard will represent a different screen in your app.

Select a preset size or define a custom size for your artboard.
 
Once you make your selection, XD opens and you have a blank screen on the XD interface.

**Naming Artboards:** The first step is to rename your artboard. Double click the current title (iPad - 1) and replace it with your chosen title. You can repeat this process for any additional artboards.

**Add Artboards:** You can now add additional artboards by clicking the artboard icon in the left menu or using the shortcut (A).  

You can add as many artboards as necessary. You can also have artboards of various sizes all in one file.  

This is helpful to show mobile, tablet, and web designs of the same app.

If you want your app to scroll, use one of the handles to stretch your artboard until you see the dotted line, or “Fold.”  

The Fold is a visual marker indicating where the images and text will begin to scroll.
