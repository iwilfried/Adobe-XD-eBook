Artboards are the foundation of your prototype design. Generally, every artboard will represent a different screen in your app.

<img style="padding: 0px 15px; float: left" src="https://iwilfried.github.io/Adobe-XD-eBook/images/XD-Artboards-01.png
" alt="no image" width="520px"/>You create your first artboard from the Start Screen.  

Select a preset size or define a custom size for your artboard.
 
Once you make your selection, XD opens and you have a blank screen on the XD interface.

**Naming Artboards:** The first step is to rename your artboard. Double click the current title (iPad - 1) and replace it with your chosen title. You can repeat this process for any additional artboards.

You can add as many artboards as necessary. You can also have artboards of various sizes all in one file.  

This is helpful to show mobile, tablet, and web designs of the same app.
